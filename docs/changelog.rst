This file contains the changelog for the project.

0.4.3 (2022-04-04)
==================
* Fix force_text import error on Django4

0.4.2 (2021-11-06)
==================
* Updates CLDR data to v39
* Support for Django 3.x
* Fixes for Brexit meaning change in VAT numbers

0.4.1 (2020-09-14)
==================
Small release containing updates to translation files. Mostly re-releasing to ensure compatibility
with the new Pip version resolver. Note that the CLDR update to v37 failed because the npm repositories
have not been updated with correct tagging.

0.4.0 (2020-05-04)
==================
* Updates Django support, removing 1.x support
* Updates Python support, removing 2.x support
* Updated CLDR data to v36
* Updated IBAN data, renaming Nordea extensions to experimental countries (based off SWIFT list)
* Updated VAT data, fixing the validation for Dutch VAT numbers
* Added a language field

Due to a packaging error, v0.4.0 as re-uploaded to PyPI without changes to the source itself.

0.3.1 (2017-01-28)
==================
* Fix Django 1.11 bug in the SortedSelect widget. This affects the sorting of optgroups for all versions, they are now
  always sorted above other choices.
* Updated CLDR data from v29 to v30.0.3
* ``timezone``: Add Metazone fields, but it is not sorted yet properly :).
* ``vat_number``: Additional cleanup for CH VAT numbers and validation for RU VAT numbers
* ``names``: Add two utilties for joining and splitting (parts of) names. It is best-effort, and not intended to be more
  than that.

0.3.0 (2016-08-20)
==================
* Fixes a Django 1.10 bug (I fixed it before, but it never made it into a release...)
* Updated CLDR and IBAN data. Note: UA got an official IBAN, so this means the Nordea alternative got dropped
  (SC also got a IBAN, but it was never in the Nordea set).

0.2.1 (2015-02-09)
==================
* Fixes a Python 3 bug discovered when releasing 0.2.0

0.2.0 (2015-02-09)
==================
* ``vat_number`` and ``iban``: Some consistency issues resolved; changed argument order and ``include_countries`` is now
  simply ``countries``.
* ``vat_number``: Do not imply ``eu_only`` when using ``vies_check``.
* ``vat_number``: Fallback to a native check if suds is not available.

0.1.2 (2014-12-18)
==================
