``django-internationalflavor`` is born to complement the ``django-localflavor`` package. While localflavor is
awesome when you are making a localized app, the reality is that you often need to accommodate for users from multiple
countries. While Django has great support for internationalization and localization, there is no package that helps you
store data from all over the world. This package aims to fill the gap and provides fields that are designed for use in
almost every country, while enforcing consistent data types.

Please note, this package is still in development. Most importantly, it lacks tests.
